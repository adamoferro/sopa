Nov 22, 2019
- dem/mola/mola128.py: added some utility functions and renamed other existing functions
- geometry/coordinate_converter.py: added some utility functions and one bug fix
- processing/simulators/*:
  - sim_base.py: grouped some common initial functions into the new _SIMBase class
  - drssim.py:
    - added Gaussian smoothing of the input DEM to avoid "stripes" in the simulations
    - calculation of ground distance from the nadir point for each contribution of the simulation
    - saving of the lat/long position of the first simulated echo sample in range for each frame
    - full vectorization of single frame simulation (removed the final range for)
  - sfrssim.py: new simulator using square facets and a cos^exp law to reduce the contribution of facets not facing the radar
- added the module plot_utils containing some classes for quick plotting of focused radargrams, simulations, ground distance images, and first return maps superimposed to the DEM


Nov 3, 2019
- added an "essential" version of the SOFA focuser, with some improvements and fully integrated with the other SOPA components
- dRSsim simulations are now created in order to match 1:1 focused data. Note: the matching precision depends on the precision of orbit and DEM data
- added the possibility to define the skip distance expressed in meters rather than in frames (so it's independent on presumming) for both dRSsim and SOFA
- created a new subfolder "processing" which includes simulators and focusers
- added the _BaseProcessingParameters that is shared between simulators and focusers in order to simulate/focus with the same parameters
- added the possibility to plug orbit data generated from an external source
- added a legacy reader for orbits previously generated for SOFA (list of files with SOFA-required format)
- moved some instrument definitions to RSInstrument base class
- added the possibility to use CO-SHARPS data with decoding errors by filling (orbit) no data gaps with a nearest neighbor approach
- other minor changes and improvements
- created this CHANGELOG file


Sep 29, 2019
- added support for PDS Italian RDR data
- io_utils/envi.py: automatically determine data type when writing and
handling of complex data
- other minor changes and bug fixes


Sep 28, 2019
1) bug fixes
2) corrected list in README
3) - added note in README
   - increased default across-track distance for dRSsim


Sep 27, 2019
- added support for PDS Italian EDR data
- switched ENVI file I/O from spectral to GDAL, using very basic
self-written functions (spectral could not manage large files)
- other minor bug fixes


Sep 6, 2019
- added support for PDS RDR US data
- mola128.py: summation of offset_to_be_added done implicitly
- coordinate_converter.py: converted some methods to static and
classmethod
- drssim.py: rxwin is calculated as the time delay that sets the
"highest point" of the simulation at sim_top_offset_samples from the top
border
- example.py: updated
- other minor changes
